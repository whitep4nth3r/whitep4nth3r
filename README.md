# Hi there! I'm Salma. I help developers build stuff, learn things, and love what they do

I currently work as a Developer Evangelist for Contentful. You can find me building stuff and
learning things live on Twitch three times a week. You will often hear me shouting about inclusivity
and accessibility.

Tech is the future, and everyone is welcome.
