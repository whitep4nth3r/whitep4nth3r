# Hi, friends! I'm Salma.

## I help developers build stuff, learn things, and love what they do.

I'm a Staff Developer Experience engineer at Netlify. I'm also a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies, a partnered live streamer on Twitch, and a qualified teacher. I love helping people get into tech.
