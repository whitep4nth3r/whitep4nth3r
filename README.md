# Hi there, I'm Salma 👋🏼

Engineer • Musician • Tech Streamer • Content creator • Inclusivity activist

## _Build stuff, learn things, love what you do_

I'm on a mission to promote access to science and technology. 

We are living in the future, and anyone, of any age, from anywhere across the globe deserves access to a wealth of tech resources, guidance and inspiration that I so deeply desired when I was younger.

## What's going on with me?

### ✨ Beginning 2021

In January 2021, I joined [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a Developer Evangelist. I am incredibly lucky to be turning my hobbies and passions that have developed over the year into a full time endeavour - where my mission is to promote accessibility and inclusivity in technology and STEM, whilst supporting a great product.

As a bonus, I'll be streaming live music improvisation streams in place of my spare-time technology streams.
